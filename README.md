# ZenYAML: A C++ wrapper around LibYAML

[LibYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) (also
[on github](https://github.com/yaml/libyaml)) is a C library for parsing YAML.

With playful spirit, I'm building a little C++ wrapper over it, as simple
and easy to use as I can. And with basically no dependency other than
LibYAML itself (e.g. no Boost).
